I am a second year Ph.D student in Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, University of Virginia. My research focuses on the integration of constrained optimization and machine learning, especially in 'predict-then-optimize' aspect. My research advisor is Prof. [Ferdinando Fioretto](https://nandofioretto.github.io/).

I received my Bachelor's degree in Applied Math from University of California, Berkeley in 2015. After graduating, I was very fortunate to join Trusting Social's team, a fintech company based in Vietnam, as a Data Scientist, working on e-KYC service and AI-based credit score. Specifically, I spent two years developing facial and image recognition products, and one year working on data mining and machine learning solutions using big social networking data. 

I was raised as a traditional Vietnamese, thus I am in love with everything comes from Asia, including: culture, destinations, people, food, and art. In my freetime, I enjoy cooking, doing my DIY projects, practicing Chinese ink-painting, swing dancing, and trekking.
