I am a first year Ph.D student in Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Syracuse University. My research focuses on  1) differential privacy in domain adaptation and fairness for decision and learning problems, and 2) integration between deep learning and continous optimization. My research advisor is Prof. [Ferdinando Fioretto](https://web.ecs.syr.edu/~ffiorett/).

I received my Bachelor's degree in Applied Math from University of California, Berkeley in 2015. After graduating, I was very fortunate to join Trusting Social's team, a fintech company based in Vietnam, as a Data Scientist, working on e-KYC service and AI-based credit score. Specifically, I spent two years developing facial and image recognition products, and one year working on data mining and machine learning solutions using big social networking data. 

I was raised as a traditional Northern Vietnamese who embraces cultural identity and refinement. I am in love with everything comes from Asia, including: culture, destinations, people, food, and art. In my freetime, I enjoy cooking, doing my DIY projects, practicing Chinese ink-painting, swing-dancing, and trekking.
